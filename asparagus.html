    <p>Even the pickiest eaters will love this simple and satisfying Parmesan-topped asparagus recipe. Best of all, it comes together quickly with just five easy-to-find ingredients.</p>
    <h3>Parmesan Asparagus Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Here's what you'll need to make this deliciously easy side dish:
</p>
<h2>oil</h2>
<p>This recipe calls for olive oil cooking spray, but you can easily grease your casserole dish with regular ol' olive oil.</p>
<h3>Asparagus</h3>
<p>Buy plump, firm asparagus stalks with tightly closed tips. The color should be vibrant and unfaded, while the stalks should be roughly the same size for even cooking.

</p>
<h2>Parmesan</h2>
<p>Freshly grated Parmesan cheese is best, but pre-shredded will work in a pinch.

</p>
<h3>sea salt</h3>
<p>Opt for a coarse sea salt for the best results. Kosher salt will work if that's all you have on hand.</p>
<h2>Garlic Powder</h2>
<p>Just a pinch of garlic powder adds bold, herbaceous flavor to this Parmesan-topped roasted asparagus.</p>

<h2>Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise
</h2>
<p>"This was so amazingly wonderful," raves leannmt. "Years ago, a friend served us asparagus in a similar way, and I was thinking of it tonight when I searched for a way to roast asparagus. This was exactly what I was looking for! It is so simple. I will be making it again and again."

 "What isn't to love?" asks Allrecipes Allstar Baking Nana. "Adjust cooking time for the size of your asparagus. About 10 minutes was good for me."
 
 "I absolutely love asparagus and this is a quick and easy way to knock out a healthy side dish or light main course," according to Arthur Enright. "I've probably made this twenty times since I found it!"</p>

 <h3>Tips</h3>
 <span>cooks note</span>
 <p>The best way to keep fresh asparagus for a long while in the refrigerator is to slice off the stems and then stand them in a bowl with a couple of inches of water in the bottom. It keeps for a very long time this way. Add water as necessary.</p>
